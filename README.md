This project is for a Virtual Books Library. Here I have developed a small module of the Library System using python, django, html, css and javascript. This can be further developed into a larger project. This is a small module of the larger system.

I have used Create, Read, Edit and Delete functionality for the books and the users of this system. Django admin can delete or add users and books can be added by registered users.
